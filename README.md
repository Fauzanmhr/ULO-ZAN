# ULO-Repository

Welcome to the **ZAN ULO-Repository**! This repository serves as a storage hub for root filesystem (rootfs) images for OpenWRT and ImmortalWRT. These images are used for the **ULO Builder**, a tool designed to streamline the building process for custom arm router firmware images.

## About This Repository

The repository contains two types of rootfs builds:

1. **Original OpenWRT/ImmortalWRT RootFS**: These are untouched, original root filesystem images sourced from OpenWRT and ImmortalWRT. They provide pure openwrt/immortalwrt experience so do not include any custom modifications.

2. **Personal Builds (ZAN Builds)**: These images have "ZAN" in their filenames and represent my personal custom builds. These include tweaks and adjustments tailored for my own usage, offering a more personalized version of the root filesystem. Use these at your own discretion, as they may differ significantly from the standard images.

## File Naming Convention

- Files with **"ZAN"** in the name are **personal builds**, containing custom modifications specific to my setup and preferences.
- Files **without "ZAN"** are **original, unmodified rootfs** files from OpenWRT or ImmortalWRT, intended to provide a standard base.

## Disclaimer

The personal builds provided in this repository are primarily for my personal use. They may not be suitable for general use cases and could include experimental features or modifications that are specific to my environment.

## Contributions

At this time, this repository is primarily focused on my personal use case, and contributions are not expected. However, feel free to fork the repository if you'd like to explore or customize the builds further.

## License

This repository does not contain any code directly, but all OpenWRT/ImmortalWRT components are licensed under their respective licenses. Be sure to check and comply with the licenses of any external components you use.
